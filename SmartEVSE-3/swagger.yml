            Enables switching between 1 phase mode and 3 phase mode by controlling a 2nd contactor (C2 port) <br /> <br />

            Note 2: This is just changing the config setting, the contactor will not be controlled immediately but only when there is a state change. <br />
            <br />
            If car is charging and you want to change from 1F to 3F or vice versa:  <br />
            - Change mode to OFF <br />
            - Enable or disable C2 contactor <br />
            - Change mode to desired mode "Not present", "Always Off", "Solar Off", "Always On", "Auto" <br />

            Enables delayed charging; always has to be combined with sending the mode in which you want to start charging. <br /> <br />
            Note 1: The time string has to be in the format "2023-04-14T23:31". <br />
            Note 2: The time must be in the future, in local time. <br />
            Note 3: Only valid when combined with Normal or Smart mode. Solar mode will itself decide when to start... <br />
